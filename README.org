* Pyphlogiston

Wrapper for Fossil (https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki) JSON API, since there wasn't any prior art on offer.

This is an incremental effort that is used as an editable checkout for a private project, and as such may appear strangely incomplete.

Emphasis is on:
- Pytest to build it up nicely, if not completely.
- Later python features. Backward compatibility not considered.
